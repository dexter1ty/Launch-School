/*
Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers, and then prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power. Do not worry about validating the input.

Example

Copy Code
==> Enter the first number:
23
==> Enter the second number:
17
==> 23 + 17 = 40
==> 23 - 17 = 6
==> 23 * 17 = 391
==> 23 / 17 = 1
==> 23 % 17 = 6
==> 23 ** 17 = 1.4105003956066297e+23
